        REQUEST FOR STATEMENT REGARDING THE PARTICIPATION OF KENYAN<br>
        EXHIBITORS IN EXPO 2025 OSAKA, JAPAN
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        <strong>Honourable Speaker,</strong> pursuant to the provisions of Standing Order 44(2)(c), I wish to request for a Statement from the Chairperson of the Departmental Committee on Trade, Industry and Cooperatives regarding the participation of Kenyan Exhibitors in Expo 2025 in Osaka, Japan.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        <strong>Honourable Speaker,</strong> the Osaka Expo 2025 is a collaborated event between the Japanese national government, various countries including Kenya, and businesses from both the domestic and international private sectors. Noting that the Expo provides a unique platform to Kenya to showcase its export products, the Kenya Export Promotion and Branding Agency (KEPROBA) selected 19 Kenyan companies to participate in promotion activities during the Expo began on 13<sup>th</sup> April 2025 and will run up to 13<sup>th</sup> October 2025 and undertook to provide exhibition space. Notably, only representatives from five out of the twenty companies travelled to Japan to showcase their products. Shockingly, upon arrival, KEPROBA withdrew its undertaking to provide exhibition space to the companies as had earlier been agreed. This decision has negatively affected the Kenyan companies who had travelled with their products and if not addressed, stands to affect the export business due to the costs incurred as a result.
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text">
        <strong>Honourable Speaker,</strong> it is against this background that I request for a Statement from the Chairperson of the Departmental Committee on Trade, Industry and Cooperatives on the following â€“
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text" style="margin-left: 30px;">
        (i) Reasons why the Kenya Export Promotion and Branding Agency (KEPROBA) rescinded its undertaking to provide exhibition space to Kenyan companies to showcase their products at the Osaka Expo 2025;
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text" style="margin-left: 30px;">
        (ii) Immediate measures being put in place to ensure the Kenyan companies in Japan showcase their products during the ongoing Osaka Expo 2025; and
    </div>
    
    <div class="body-text" style="margin-left: 30px;">
        (iii) Long term plans being put in place to enhance promotion of Kenyan products internationally.

    <div class="body-text" style="margin-top: 20px;">
        I thank you, <strong>Honourable Speaker.</strong>
